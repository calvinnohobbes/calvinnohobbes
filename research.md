# Research



These are the open projects that we are currently working on. Both of these projects have been funded by [Science Foundation Ireland](https://www.sfi.ie/) . 

**RODEO: Root Dynamics for Ecosystem Observation** In RODEO, we are building a network of root-shoot observatories at ecosystem greenhouse gas observation sites to study the linkage between root and shoot phenology and what this means for the carbon cycle.

Phenology is the way living things change through the seasons. For plants, phenology affects how much CO2 they take up in photosynthesis or release as they die, so phenology affects climate change. But climate change is altering phenology, such as more growth in warm winters or less in dry summers. Hence understanding phenology is critical for climate change predictions.

We can study plant phenology using cameras or satellites collecting sequences of images. However, around 1/3 of CO2 taken up is transported belowground to root systems. Roots are difficult to study as soil is opaque. Other scientists have found that roots don’t grow at the same time as leaves, but we don’t understand why in a general way that can be used in predictions. 

RODEO will use robotic instruments and AI for image analysis to gather data on root phenology. We will use this to try and get a general understanding of root growth to use to improve future climate models.

This is a SFI funded National Challenge Fund Project where we are building non-destructive tools to measure physiological status of roots. Ensuring the health of plants is vital for sustainable and productive agriculture. Since a significant portion of plant structure is underground, the well-being and functioning of roots may precede or not be mirrored in the condition of leaves. Despite this, methods to evaluate the health and physiological state of roots in the field remain rudimentary, hampering the effective management of agricultural systems in an era marked by increasing uncertainties. 

Root health and disease is difficult to assess and measure quickly in the field with simple tools. We aim to deliver these in a low tech, user-friendly way, so they can be used in future food systems by everyday users. RootCheck aims to develop an innovative, sturdy handheld sensor attachment for smartphones that enables swift assessment of root health using multispectral imaging techniques. 

By placing the capability to assess root health and physiology directly in the hands of farmers, RootCheck facilitates rapid, quantitative diagnosis from fresh field samples and contributes to the effective management of Future Food Systems.

We are currently in the early phases in the project.
